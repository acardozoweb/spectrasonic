            <p>spectrasonic brings a wide range of acts to Ottawa and beyond, ranging from punk to folk
                to metal to comedy.
            </p><p>
                our first show was with Fugazi in a community centre basement in 1989 and we haven't
                looked back.
                booking national and international touring acts in bars, concert halls, theatres and arenas while
                continuing to develop new bands in intimate venues.
